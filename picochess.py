# Mollis Personal Picochess versions
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following enhancements to the 0.9N version have been implemented:
#        0.  Version set to 1.0 (finally ;-)
#        1.  Voice announcements even if time < 1 minute
#        2.  Possibility to continue playing even if one player runs out of time
#        3.  Pre-Moves: Computer and user moves can be done in rapid sequence
#            (no need to wait for registration of computer move). Even the
#            own move could be played before computer move - it doesn't matter
#        4.  New flexible ponder mode: no more checks if valid moves, position can
#            be setup without any restrictions (of course it must be a legal one)
#            Makes analysis and playing differenet variants much easier
#        5.  Remote mode working again (without room handling, see menue.py)
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#        6.  Version set to 2.0
#        7.  Framework for adding (more or less funny) speech comments based on
#            various events
#        8.  Rolling display of time/score/depth/hintmove in Ponder On or Normal Mode
#        9.  Continue directly after start with an interrupted game if board still shows
#            last position by reading the last games pgn file
#        10. New cool training mode with training options (with big thanks to Wilhelm!!!)
#        11. Configuration parameters for all 1.00/2.00 enhancements in picochess.ini
#        12. Various bug fixes (eg. pressing the outer buttons for quick restart
#            instead of shutdown like it was intended, calc. error in evaluation)
#            Again: big thanks to Wilhelm!
#        13. Renaming of the play modes! Now we have:
#            New mode name                                         Old mode name
#            a5 NORMAL (rolling info display off by default)       NORMAL
#            b5 PONDER ON (rolling info display on by default)     BRAIN
#            c5 MOVE HINT                                          ANALYSIS
#            d5 EVAL.SCORE                                         KIBITZ
#            e5 OBSERVE                                            OBSERVE
#            f5 ANALYSIS (flexible option on by default)           PONDER
#            g5 TRAINING (this is new in 2.00)                       -
#            h5 REMOTE (working again from 1.00 on)                REMOTE
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#        14. Version set to 2.01
#        15. Added possibility to change voice volume via menu and picochess.ini
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#        16. Version set to 3.0 (a really big one ;-)
#            I think most of the enhancements only make sense running on a Revelation II (or at least
#            a DGTPI with better display capabilities. Especially on a Revelation II it is really fun
#            to read game comments or the opening name etc. while this is exhausting on a DGTPI and awful
#            on a standalone DGT Clock with its 8 chars)
#            Some features (like tournament control or PicoTutor) even wouldn't correctly work on stand
#            alone clocks together with picochess because the display can not show the correct time control
#            setting.
#            Furthermore additional libraries must be installed, a bug must be fixed in the python-chess
#            code itself(!) for the tournament control option and you need additional engines for some
#            of the new feature (don't ask me where to get them or where you can get an image etc.)
#            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#            !!! Keep in mind: I did these enhancements in this Personal Version for my own pleasure
#            !!! in order to have fun & play with picochess on my Revelation 2 - so it might be not
#            !!! your cup of tea...
#            !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#        17. Support for Online Engines
#             - Switch to Online Mode if online engine is choosen (engine name starts with
#               Prefix 'Online')
#             - Time control settings are taken from the online server challenge and are
#               applied automatically as current time control settings
#             - Clocks start after first white and black moves. After this the player's time already
#               starts with the annoucement of the best move and no longer when
#               the computer move has been done by the user (other than that no real sync with server
#               times has been implemented)
#             - Online decrement: In order to better "sync" picochess times with online server times
#               you can subtract X seconds after each own move from your remaining game time in
#               picochess.ini, default value is 0.9s
#             - additional online info messages (login, seeking, opponent name, game result)
#             - new online seek in case of 'start new game' event
#             - Online move is automatically played in case of white = online opponent and clock starts
#             - last move is published to online engine in case of game ending to inform the online
#               server
#             - online player names in pgn file(s) instead of engine or pico user name only
#             - Online engines won't be saved in picochess.ini as last engine
#             - picochess.ini "Online decrement" parameter can be overwritten in online uci files via parameter
#               OnlineDecrement (just add "[DEFAULT]  OnlineDecrement = X"
#             - still work in progress (don't ask me when they are ready to play...):
#               - basic FICS online engine (for this TELNET must have been installed, default!?)
#               - very basic lichess online engine (for this the BESERK package must have been installed)
#        18. (Better) support for MAME emulated chess engines
#             - requirement: new SDL libraries (probably different for BUSTER)
#                            and Q5 library must have been installed
#             - newer mame/mess versions do need BUSTER!
#             - longer startup time for mame engines necessary, voice/sound end messages from mame engine
#               last ending move is published to emulator engine in case of game end for specific engines
#             - "engine setup" message because of longer initializing phase of mame chess engines
#             - support for pico timecontrol setting in uci file settings according to mame engine levels
#               (just define the UCI parameter PicoTimeControl X Y Z in your level settings) and time is set
#               automatically after choosing a level
#             - When switching back to non mame engine time settings are reset to last setting before it has been
#               eventually changed by the uci setting (default time setting can be defined in picochess.ini
#               via parameter def-timectrl when having a mame engine as last engine after startup)
#             - automatic reset of the original time control settings after choosing a non mame/mess engine
#             - mame engine should not be saved as last used engine on a DGTPI because of possible clock problems when
#               starting mame engine directly after boot (very strange maybe a sync problem with dgtpicom lib!?)
#        19. Finally: practical support of remote engines and local engines at the same time(!)
#             - IMPORTANT! For windows server access an update of the spur and paraminko packages and a
#               modification of the spur package are necessary (ssh.py must be replaced from a different repository)
#             - name in engine.ini must start with prefix 'remote_'
#             - implemented via standard ssh connection, just add the remote login infos
#               in the corresponding parameters of picochess.ini and your remote engine in engines.ini
#               and make sure SSH server is running on your remote computer (default on MacOS)
#        20. Automatic takeback mode (only for mame engines) in case of a blunder move with active PicoTutor
#            (PicoWatcher must be switched on)
#             - Normally taking back moves when using mame engine is not possible so this is a nice feature for
#               beginners (like me ;-) who often play against mame engines.
#             - only the last blunder move can be taken back when using mame (of course this restriction is not
#               valid for other native uci engines!)
#        21. Bugfix: Set correct (old) engine (name) in case of engine error (very important for
#                    new remote/online engines which sould easily fail if server is not available)
#        22. Taking back moves: Now the next move which could be taken back is shown in display and
#            in long notation format (good for old people like me ;-)
#        23. After start up and new game events the current chosen engine is shown in the display
#            (setting in display menu & config parameter in picochess.ini)
#        24. Support for correct remaining game times for continued games from version 2 (finally!)
#        25. Synthesized voice support for moves in WebServer (unfortunately works only in desktop
#            browsers and in Android Firefox browser): Big thanks to Martin (author of the ingenious
#            TuroChamp python engine) and deletion of the non working remote room button functionality
#            Of course you can still use the remote play mode functionality (re)introduced since 2.0 and
#            the new handling of remote engines)
#        26. Replay of PGN games (semi automatic) via new engine
#            - Semi automatic replay of saved pgn games with hint move/score evaluation by an analysis engine
#              for a specific thinking period (time settings will be changed according to uci file and changed
#              back automatically)
#            - "Guess that move" game option for white or black (switch "guessing" sides by pressing the lever)
#            - Additionally this pgn replay mode can be used to train opening books when setting
#              an empty pgn file with name 'Book Test' and choosing a specific book in menu: just try and play
#              a move you think belongs to the chosen book opening (makes more sense when you create specific books
#              with a specific theme or famous player moves)
#            - Furthermore an audio comment file for the pgn file can be specified and will be automatically
#              played during the pgn game replay and can be manually started and stopped during the match
#              (I did this because I have a (german) genious radio play "Nahrungsaufnahme während der Zeitnotphase"
#               which is playing in real time during a tournament game. Now I can listen to the radio play and
#               watch the game at the same time with picochess - how cool is that!?
#            - PGN Replay engine settings won't be saved in picochess.ini as last engine 
#        27. Enhancement of supported tags in pgn file: opening eco code, pico remaining times, pico time
#            control setting
#        28. For online-, emulation- and pgn-mode: Automatically switch off opening books (setting "no book"
#            as book option)
#        29. Override pgn location from picochess.ini in case the parameter 'location' is set to
#            something different than 'auto' (you can use this if you always get a wrong auto
#            location).
#        30. Basic chess tutor functionality (even in case the choosen engine does not support
#            score & hint moves like almost all mame emulated engines) with the following 3
#            functions (disabled in Online mode)
#            a) Pico Watcher (checks your moves and returns ??, ?, !?, ?!, !, !!)
#               You can change the control limits for the evalutations in file picotutor_constants.py
#            b) Pico Coach (gives position score and move hint(s) - just lift a piece and put it back into
#               the same position)
#            c) Pico Opening Explorer (displays current opening name (alternative) independet of the
#               used opening book
#        31. Tournament time control settings:
#            Possible time control settings in picochess v3.0:
#            time = m, time = g i, time = n g i  or time = n g1 i g2
#            Examples:
#            time = ... 7   (time per move, eg. m = 7 seconds)
#                       5 0 (game time, eg. Blitz g = 5 min. and 0 seconds increment)
#                       5 3 (game time g= 5 min. plus I = 3 sec. increment)
#            Tournament time control settings: n moves in g1 minutes (plus I increment seconds) and rest
#            of the game in g2 minutes
#            time = ...
#            new:   40 5 0 (n = 40 moves in g = 5 minutes)
#            new:   40 5 3 ((n = 40 moves in g= 5 minutes with I = 3s Fischer inc.)
#            new:   40 60 0 30 (n = 40 moves in g1 = 90 minutes, I = 0 seconds increment and rest of the game in g2 = 30 minutes)
#            **************
#            * Important: *
#            **************
#            for this a python-chess bug in 22.1 version must have been fixed to support the
#            movestogo go command option correctly!
#            If you have a higher python version look there (eg. 3.7 on BUSTER)
#            (in file /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/chess/uci.py:
#             line 949  original:   if movestogo is not None and movestogo > 0:
#                       changed to: if movestogo is not None and int(movestogo) > 0:
#             That was not so easy to figure out...)
#        32. Possibility to directly play an alternative move for the engine on the board after the engine move
#            has been displayed in NORMAL mode (like in TRAINING mode or the DGT CENTAUR chess computer)
#            (setting in menu and config para)
#        33. Menu for saving, reading and continuing a game from pgn files (yes, finally!)
#            *** IMPORTANT ***
#            In order to load and continue a saved game you will need to use the webserver in order to set up
#            the correct starting position of the game. For this you must open the webserver page BEFORE
#            you read and restore the game or if not just use the sync button!
#        34. Display of the book opening name(s) (function of the PicoTutor)
#        35. New time control setting: Support of a specific max. search depth (with a fixed
#            countdown movetime of 11:11 (unfortunately counting up the clock is not possible)
#        36. Support of written game comments like it used to be in Boris or Sargon 2.5 MGS old chess computers
#        37. Display of pgn event, players & result when loading an existing game
#        38. Enhancements of REV2 and webserver display of moves/evaluation/depth/score
#        39. Display of „new position“ message in case of analysis mode and user sets up
#            a new position instead of playing an legal move (or in case he plays an illegal
#            move which is seen as a new position)
#        40. Removed use of vorbis ogg player because of audio play conflicts with sound from
#            mame chess engines in picotalker.py and OS update problems and missing start/stop/pause
#            functions(now pygame.mixer is used instead), see <https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html>
#            install additional lib via: "sudo apt-get install python3-pygame"
#        50. Three new voices (one with commentary): Daniel (eng.), Boris (eng. with commentary)
#            and Gust (german). Additinal voice samples (eng./german) for the new picochess V3.0
#            feature which can be put additionally in all existing voice folders
#        51. Specific 'set pieces' sound (no voice) so you hear when something wrong with the board position
#        52. Set opponent pgn player to 'Player B' instead of engine name and user name ro 'Player A'
#            in case of 'Observe Mode'
#        53. No more searchmoves in UCI 'go' command for the engine in case normal moves (exception:
#            Alternative moves), otherwise this might cause problems with the use of internal
#            engine books etc.(thanks to Rasmus for the hint)
#        54. BugFix for Buster: Change of voice volume working again (big thanks to Wilhelm!)
#        55. New (Fischer) "simulated" median move time levels: 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 30s, 60s, 90s
#            (thanks to the schachcomputer.info Forum for this idea!)
#        56. New "favorite engines" options: It is nice to have all 60 and more engines installed
#            but it is a pain to select one out of these many engines...
#            => new Favorite menu to keep your main and most often used engine separately.
#               just put your favorite engines into the favorite.ini file liek you would do for the
#               main engine list in engine.ini and put it in the correct egine directory - that's it
#               *** IMPORTANT ***
#               Engines in favorite.ini must also appear in engines.ini!!!
#        57. BugFix: Continue game/load saved game and play in opposite board direction fixed
#        58. Support of engine subfolders: you can now organize your engines in subfolders
#            within the main engine folder (just specify the subfolder path in engines.ini in
#            in front of the filename eg. [MAME/mm5] where MAME is a subfolder within the armv7l
#            folder (thanks to Wilhelm for supporting the correct engine startup loading procedure!)
#        59. Fix for the strange clock times reset "bug" when playing without a clock with just a board,
#            PI and the webserver. With the voice move announcements of the webserver in V3.0 we even
#            don't have to look at the webserver screen when playing... (thanks to Marcel Swidde for
#            the fix in the picochess google groups forum)
#        60. Position correction message after the "Set pieces" error message occurs the second time:
#            assuming that you are lost and don't know where to put the piece to its correct position,
#            picochess will tell you what is wrong and how to correct (if you have your PI hooked up
#            into your WLAN you could just check the correct position with the webserver board display
#            by just pressing the Sync button of the webserver).
#            Picochess will stop the clocks and check its internal game position against the external
#            DGT board position and will display two kind of correction messages:
#            - Put w N f3 (=> put white night on f3)
#            - Clear h5 (=> remove piece from h5)
#            This will continue as long as the correct position has been set up.
